## Third rules

Probably one of the mosts important tool I use in my compositions.
Help you organize your picture in thirds.
The function needs a vec2 UVs not centered in screen space.
It returns a float so that you can add the value in your mainImage function

## Vignette

Certainly the most simple effect to know. It's like doing a circle.
Use centerd screenspace uvs and change force to have more or less vignette effect.
It can be use with background or by multiplying result color for an overlay effect.
